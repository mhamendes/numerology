  "data": "Kabbalistic numerology came from Hermes Trismegistus, author of the Seven Universal Laws presented in the book “The Kybalion”.\n\nIt is the science of knowledge and a guide for the life of any individual. Pythagoras said that “numbers govern the lives of all human beings” and by knowing our numbers, we understand the reasons why we go through certain problematic situations during life and by coming into balance with these numbers we have the possibility to eliminate burdens, enjoy the abundance of the Universe and find our purpose in this existence."
