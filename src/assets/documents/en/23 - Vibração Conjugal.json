  "title": "23 - Conjugal Vibration",
  "description": "Modern Numerology performs an analysis of the energetic vibration of the relationship between two people. Love and friendship, beneficial relationships, fatal attractions, challenging relationships, and soulmates. It is important to note that this analysis is only an indicator that serves as guidance, as it is completely impossible to determine with accuracy whether this or that element is harmonious and will be successful with this or that person. Numerology does not take into account whether the person is married or not, but rather if the couple is romantically and sexually involved.\n\nIMPORTANT: Nowadays, it is common for couples to adopt each other's surname when they get married (not mandatory). And many times we hear from partners who have changed their surname that they were much happier when they were single than after marriage. In the vast majority of cases, this destabilization of the couple is caused by the change (without any analysis) of the surname upon marriage. Another factor of great importance for both people involved is when one or both, after having their names analyzed through Numerology, do not change their Expression number. In this case, the Love number does not undergo any change, which also happens with the Mission number, which remains unchanged. Individuals with the same Love number are compatible and harmonious, but the relationship tends to become monotonous over the years, except for the number 5 (five), where one element complements the other. It is essential that the coexistence needs to be continuously ”nourished”, where the imagination of both must be cultivated daily.",

    "1": "This number is that of the idyll (poetic love), but the attraction must have an intellectual basis. As this number also stimulates variety, it will not be very easy to achieve a lasting union, as there will be the temptation to deal with two things at the same time. Furthermore, the intellectual tendency will harm the fire of passion, which you seek in vain. Marriages can occur suddenly, and meetings can occur when you are traveling far from home or in a study center. The holder of this number must always be cautious in married life, as there may be the danger of extramarital adventures caused by boredom or lack of mental freedom.",
    "2": "This number is discriminating in the choice of a spouse, mainly because of its strong interest in comfort and stability. Suggestion can play an important role in your life, and you must be careful to prevent undue criticism from relatives or friends, that is, interference in your love life. There may also be secret friendships of a purely platonic nature, which should be approached with caution to avoid marital disagreements. You will want an intelligent person, but above all practical and capable of ensuring the financial security you desire.",
    "3": "Sometimes you have the misfortune of meeting your ideal partners too late, when they are usually already married, and if you are not careful, you may become part of a triangle, instead of waiting for another partner who is free. You are too idealistic to share your marriage, but your spirit of sacrifice can be maliciously exploited by those you trust. There may be one or more near-mistakes, but you have the protection that prevents you from being tied to a person of unbearable temperament or bad character. If you let your intuition act, your choice will be correct, as you understand very well the motivations of people and, as a rule, you will choose someone whose interests match yours, thus finding the ideal partner for life.",
    "4": "You will feel a strong attraction to marriage due to your emotional and affectionate nature, but you will not always have the necessary discretion, and your choice may bring you difficulties. Your path will be further complicated by the envy and spite of others, and by your tendency to judge others excessively by their appearance. In marriage, although you seek an active and dominant partner, there may be marital friction quite frequently if there are many demands on your part. Your partner will be interested in the occult and may make you interested in their intellectual superiority.",
    "5": "This number entails travel, changes, and variety. It is almost certain that the person will marry and separate more than once due to restlessness and a taste for change. On the other hand, the two spouses, even separated, can maintain business together, as there is a tendency towards friendship. You are not very selective in your relationships, especially until the age of 25, and with that, you constantly change partners, always looking for the 'ideal.' Obstacles and delays will be common in youth, and it is advisable to marry after the age of thirty, and with a person of the same age or even a little older.",
    "6": "Not being very precocious, people with this number, although ardent inside, are shy and not very expressive. However, they experience periods of exaltation caused by inner ardor, and if there is no care, such ardor may lead to the formation of alliances of not very satisfactory nature that, if they end in marriage, can cause unhappiness. It is not a very strong number, presenting some hesitation and variety, and people governed by it must be very careful not to desire new companies that could harm the marital state, especially when they are away from the other spouse. If marriage occurs after the age of 33, there will be more hope for its success and stability.",
    "7": "People governed by this number are often considered flirtatious and even fickle. This is not true. Although they should not marry very young, that is, before their character and tastes are well defined, this almost always happens, and as a result, these relationships usually do not last long. They are so active, both mentally and physically, that their existence is very varied, and they usually know a much larger number of people than those governed by other numbers, except for five. They often marry more than once and have many love affairs without seeking adventures, especially during the marriage. There will be many separations from loved ones, friends, and even premature deaths of loved ones. As a rule, they have a lot of responsibility from a young age.",
    "8": "People governed by this number marry for life, as they are sincere and honorable, but curiously, many times there are broken romances before marriage due to the lack of sincerity of the other party. If such a thing happens, the person may take a long time to recover, and if they become widowed after a happy marriage, the person governed by this number rarely marries again. Religion and philosophy play an important role in their life, and although the sexual impulse is strong, there is a feeling of scruple that avoids indulgence in sex before marriage. Companionship is a matter of vital importance for these people, and as courtship is usually conducted with a lot of discretion and good sense, the performance of joint activities will make the marriage happy and lasting.",
    "9": "Marriage will be the supreme and constant aspiration, and you will sacrifice all your thoughts, hopes, and aspirations to it from a very young age. In youth, the tendency is to like and even date people much older than you, which may cause you some problems, particularly when, over time, you become interested in younger people. You must be careful to ensure that your professional goals and activities are compatible with those of your spouse, otherwise, you will have many disappointments and annoyances."
